// Tap.             Touch-down followed by touch-up inside. Applicable to most controls.

// Long Press.      After control is held down for X seconds, activate the function without requiring the user to
//                  release the control (control would 'auto-release' on function change of state.
//                  Should be associated with a visual timer to show user how long the control needs to be held for.
//                  For functions that require adding some workflow friction to mitigate unintended events,
//                  like deleting user, unlocking touchpad.

// Continuous.      Activate associated function while control is being pressed (on touch-down) and stop activation
//                  on touch-up. For functions that need continuous confirmation as a safety mitigation.

// WhilePressing.   if we decide to show sometime like a tooltips. I.e., we show a screen element, like a help text,
//                  while the user is pressing an icon.
//                  I currently have one of these on the boot screen (an (i) icon) to show SW version number and
//                  system ID (although I may get rid of that extra action and just show the detail onscreen
//                  because hiding it doesn't really make sense to me).
//                  So there are 4. I'll define all these and make sure they get documented in some sort of spec.

// Keyboard.        Keyboard behavior allowing entry of diacritics by showing additional buttons after a medium
//                  (not too long) press.
